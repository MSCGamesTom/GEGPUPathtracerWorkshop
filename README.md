# GPU Path Tracer

This repository contains a simple pedagogic interactive path tracer built on top of DirectX 12 and DXR for the the Games Engineering course at Warwick. It demonstrates how to:
- Create and manage a **Direct3D 12** device
- Load and build scenes (e.g., Cornell box, living room, etc.)
- Implement a real-time path tracer with an HLSL shader
- Load and use textures
- Read from a shader file
- Interactively control the camera and scene parameters

The scenes are in the [GEMScene](https://github.com/MSCGamesTom/GEM) format used by the Games Engineering course at Warwick.

## Features
- **Real-time GPU Path Tracing**: Uses DirectX 12 compute and graphics queues to render scenes via path tracing.
- **Multiple Scenes**: Load various 3D scenes, from the Cornell box to more complex environments.
- **Interactive Camera**: Move around the scene with WASD keys and adjust viewing angles using mouse input.
- **Shader Hot-Reload** (optional): Easily switch or adjust HLSL shaders if you want to experiment with different materials or shading models.
- **Texture Management**: Utilize [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to load textures from files and convert them into GPU resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Windows 10 or later** (64-bit)
2. **Visual Studio 2019/2022** with the C++ development environment installed, or another compiler toolchain that supports C++17 (or newer).
3. **DirectX 12-compatible GPU** and updated graphics drivers.

### Building the Project
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred environment). If you have a `.sln` file, double-click it. Otherwise, create a new Visual Studio solution or CMake project that includes all `.cpp` and `.h` files in the `Graphics` directory, plus the main `Main.cpp`.
3. Make sure you link against the necessary **Windows SDK** libraries (e.g., `d3d12.lib`, `dxgi.lib`, and `dxguid.lib`).
4. Build the solution in **Debug** or **Release** mode.

> **Note:** If you are using CMake, ensure you set up `find_package(DirectX12 REQUIRED)` or manually link the required DirectX 12 libraries.

## Running the Application
1. After building, run the generated executable.  
2. The application will open a new window with the **Cornell box** scene by default.  
3. Use the controls below to move the camera or switch scenes (by modifying the `sceneName` variable in `Main.cpp`).

## Directory Structure
```
Graphics/
??? Camera.h          // Camera class and logic
??? Core.cpp          // Core initialization for D3D12
??? Core.h
??? GEMLoader.h       // Geometry and mesh loading functionality
??? Math.h            // Basic math utilities
??? RTSceneLoader.h   // Scene loading logic for path tracer
??? Scene.h           // Scene class - manages objects, lights, etc.
??? Shaders.h         // Shader management class
??? stb_image.h       // External library for loading textures
??? Texture.h         // GPU texture handling and SRV creation
??? Timer.h           // High-resolution timing utilities
??? Window.h          // Window creation, input handling

Main.cpp              // Entry point (WinMain), sets up everything
```

## Supported Scenes
In `Main.cpp`, you will see a series of commented lines with different scene names (e.g., `"cornell-box"`, `"bathroom"`, `"kitchen"`, etc.).  
- To change the scene, simply modify:
  ```cpp
  std::string sceneName = "cornell-box";
  ```
  to the desired scene (e.g., `"kitchen"`). Ensure that the scene assets or files exist in the expected location.

## Controls
- **W**: Move camera forward  
- **S**: Move camera backward  
- **A**: Strafe camera left  
- **D**: Strafe camera right  
- **Left Mouse Button**: Click and drag to rotate the camera  
- **Esc**: Exit application  

Each time you move or look around, the path tracer resets the sample accumulator (so it starts at SPP = 0 again) and accumulates samples over time.
